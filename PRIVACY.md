- **Non-Personal Information:** We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as statistics on how the bot is used (e.g., the frequency of certain commands or features).
- **Discord Data:** If you link your Discord account with the bot (for example, using the `osulink` command), we may collect your Discord user ID to associate it with your account on the bot.

**4. Data Retention**  
We store data as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Non-personal information may be retained indefinitely for analysis and improvement of the bot’s functionality. Personal data, such as your Discord ID, will only be stored if you have linked it to your bot account and may be deleted upon request.

**5. Data Security**  
We take reasonable measures to protect your data. However, please note that no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. While we make efforts to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data you transmit to the bot.

**7. Third-Party Links and Services**  
The bot may include links to third-party websites or services (such as for osu! integration). These third-party services are not controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties.

**8. User Rights**  
You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. If you wish to unlink your Discord account from the bot or request data deletion, you can contact the bot creator directly.
