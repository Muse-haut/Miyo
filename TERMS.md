**4. Bot Interactions**  
Besides commands, the bot can interact in two additional ways:

This bot includes an integrated moderation system. Moderators are exempt from these restrictions.  

The bot enforces moderation in three main ways:

- Preventing spam of bot commands.  

These moderation features cannot currently be disabled. Thank you for your understanding.
